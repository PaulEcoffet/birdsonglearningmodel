    Parameters
    ----------
    song : 1D array_like
        The song to extract syllables from.
    threshold : float, optional
        Threshold for the amplitude of the song to determine when a syllable
        begins and ends. When the amplitude is above the threshold, the
        syllable begins and ends when the amplitude goes under this threshold.
        If threshold is None, then it will be infered by a taking all the
        amplitude sorted and selecting the amplitude for which there is the
        biggest jump in value between this amplitude and the next one.
        The difference are smoothen with a running mean first. See code for
        more details.

    Returns
    -------

        been computed for this syllable, in addition to the beg and end of the
