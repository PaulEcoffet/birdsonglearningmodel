	abstract = {Highly coordinated learned behaviors are key to understanding neural processes integrating the body and the environment. Birdsong production is a widely studied example of such behavior in which numerous thoracic muscles control respiratory inspiration and expiration: the muscles of the syrinx control syringeal membrane tension, while upper vocal tract morphology controls resonances that modulate the vocal system output. All these muscles have to be coordinated in precise sequences to generate the elaborate vocalizations that characterize an individual's song. Previously we used a low-dimensional description of the biomechanics of birdsong production to investigate the associated neural codes, an approach that complements traditional spectrographic analysis. The prior study used algorithmic yet manual procedures to model singing behavior. In the present work, we present an automatic procedure to extract low-dimensional motor gestures that could predict vocal behavior. We recorded zebra finch songs and generated synthetic copies automatically, using a biomechanical model for the vocal apparatus and vocal tract. This dynamical model described song as a sequence of physiological parameters the birds control during singing. To validate this procedure, we recorded electrophysiological activity of the telencephalic nucleus {HVC}. {HVC} neurons were highly selective to the auditory presentation of the bird's own song ({BOS}) and gave similar selective responses to the automatically generated synthetic model of song ({AUTO}). Our results demonstrate meaningful dimensionality reduction in terms of physiological parameters that individual birds could actually control. Furthermore, this methodology can be extended to other vocal systems to study fine motor control.},

	shorttitle = {Three models of song learning},
	abstract = {Research on avian song learning has traditionally been based on an instructional model, as exemplified by the sensorimotor model of song development. Several large-scale, species-wide field studies of learned birdsongs have revealed that variation is narrowly restricted to certain aspects of song structure. Other aspects are sufficiently stereotyped and so widely shared by species' members that they qualify as species-specific universals. The limitations on natural song variation are difficult to reconcile with a fully open, instructive model of song learning. An alternative model based on memorization by selection postulates a system of innate neural templates that facilitate the recognition and rapid memorization of conspecific song patterns. Behavioral evidence compatible with this model includes learning preferences, rapid conspecific song learning, and widespread ocurrence of species-specific song universals that are recognized innately but fail to develop in songs of social isolates. A third model combines instruction, in the memorization phase, with selection during song production. An overproduced repertoire of plastic songs previously memorized by instruction is winnowed by selection imposed during social interactions at the time of adult song crystallization. Selection during production is well established as a factor in the song development of several species, in the form of action-based learning. The possible role of selective processes in song memorization merits further neurobiological investigation.},

	abstract = {Executing a motor skill requires the brain to control which muscles to activate at what times. How these aspects of control - motor implementation and timing - are acquired, and whether the learning processes underlying them differ, is not well understood. To address this we used a reinforcement learning paradigm to independently manipulate both spectral and temporal features of birdsong, a complex learned motor sequence, while recording and perturbing activity in underlying circuits. Our results uncovered a striking dissociation in how neural circuits underlie learning in the two domains. The basal ganglia was required for modifying spectral, but not temporal structure. This functional dissociation extended to the descending motor pathway, where recordings from a premotor cortex analogue nucleus reflected changes to temporal, but not spectral structure. Our results reveal a strategy in which the nervous system employs different and largely independent circuits to learn distinct aspects of a motor skill.},
