\section*{Problem Statement}

The Zebra Finches are songbirds which learn the song of their tutor. They learn
it from 20 days post hatch (DPH) to 80 DPH \parencite{liu_juvenile_2004}. Their
learning can be split in three phases: i) they have a babbling phase from 20 DPH
to 40 DPH, then ii) a plastic song in which protosyllables from the tutor song
are produced then iii) a crystallized song at 80 DPH with a fixed song which is
a copy of the tutor's song.\todo{check the days} Zebra finches are commonly used
as a model of speech acquisition.

\textcite{deregnaucourt_how_2005} showed that sleep plays an important role in
the learning of tutor songs. Indeed, they showed that sleeping has a negative
impact on song restitution by zebra finches in the short term but a positive
impact on the long run. Indeed, song restitution is less complex and less
similar to the tutor song from one morning to the previous day evening, but the
greater this loss in performance was overall for one bird, the better this bird
will reproduce the tutor song at the end of its learning.
\textcite{dave_song_2000} has found replay sequences of neurones in the motor
cortex which correspond to their activity pattern when the birds sing in adult
zebra finches during their sleep. This shows that neurones that are highly
correlated with bird's own song (BOS) are activated during the night.

Our hypothesis is that during its sleep, the zebra finch restructures the
knowledge it has acquired so far. We hypothesize that this restructuring can
account for the loss of performance in the short term and an improvement of
performance in the long term.

The goal of this internship is to propose a model of the zebra finch song
learning which can explain different behavioral data observed such as the
correlation between the loss of performance every night and the overall
performance at the end of learning, and the different phases of bird song
learning (babbling, protosyllables, crystallized song).

\section*{Investigation/Research}

We want to build a model which is the most plausible in a real world environment
and which is biological plausible. To do so, we will use a bird song synthesizer
made by \textcite{boari_automatic_2015}. This synthesizer is a biophysical model
of zebra finch vocal apparatus. This synthesizer has the advantage that it be
parametrized with relatively few parameters to produce realistic bird songs. As
it models the zebra finch vocal apparatus, it is likely that the parameters we
send to this synthesizer must be similar to the instruction sent by the zebra
finch motor cortex to the vocal apparatus muscles. Indeed, the parameters for
this synthesizer is the the labia tension \(\alpha(t)\) and the air-sac pressure
\(\beta(t)\) in the apparatus.\todo{check alpha and beta that I keep mixing up}
\textcite{amador_elemental_2013,boari_automatic_2015} have managed to reproduce
zebra finches song using this synthesizer. The synthetical songs they produced
activated neurons in HVC which are highly selective to bird's own song (BOS).
This shows that the synthesized songs are accurate reproduction of BOS.

\textcite{amador_low_2014,boari_automatic_2015} have already found interesting
data by studying the parameters. Indeed, they have found that what can be seen
as syllable in the sensory space can be seen as one or several gestures in the
parameters space. Indeed, syllable are yield with continuous modification of the
parameters. A new syllable will trigger a huge discontinuity in the parameter
values.

\textcite{amador_elemental_2013} even claim to have found correlation with HVC
neuron spikes in zebra finches and the gesture trajectory extrema (beginning,
maximum, minimum and end) of these gestures. Though, very recent literature
shows that these correlates might have been untrue
\parencite{lynch_rhythmic_2016,picardo_population-level_2016}. Even though there
is no neural correlate with gesture trajectory extrema (GTE), we hypothesize
that GTE identification may play an important role in song learning, as they
signal changes in the progression of the parameters through time.

\section*{Proposed Solution}

Our goal is to design a simple hill climbing model (see Fig.~\ref{fig:topView})
that fits one specific gesture.

\ifx
* Babbling + goal oriented
* segmentation of the syllables
* hill climbing
* Likely won't be enough:
  * Different strategies are not taken into account
  * Transition between syllable might not be doable: Bi-gram?
\fi

\section*{Expected Implementation}

\ifx
* Find good auditory and memory system
  * Must be biologically plausible
  --> Buenos Aires Synthesizer
  --> MFCC seems good but we cannot do what we are looking for with it yet
  --> Nearest-Neighbors
  --> Interest model for babbling then socially imposed goal (tutor song)
    \parencite{baranes_active_2013}
* Use Explauto \parencite{moulin-frier_explauto:_2014}
\fi

\section*{Analysis \& Testing}


\ifx
* Can we observe protosyllable, syllable and song: as in clustering that happens
*
\fi

\section*{Final Evaluation}
\ifx
* Design new hypotheses
